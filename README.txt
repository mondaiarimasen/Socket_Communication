I. Motivation

  - want to get the temperature of the 8 channels in the dilution refrigerator
  (DR)

  - monitor the temperature remotely for convenience

  - facilitate data and error analysis

*****************************************************************************
II. Program Descriptions

  - my_socket.py
        ->  first program to take data; used to take data over Aug.3 - Aug.6

  - plotter_socket.py
        ->  plots the data in 'tempData.dat'; simply run it with the data you
            want to plot in 'tempData.dat', but needs to be in a specific
            format

  - realTime_my_socket.py
        ->  reads temperature from channel 2 of LS372 and plots in real time;
            two types of plots are available: 'static' graph (x-axis is not
            fixed length, so accommodates more and more data with time) and
            'shifting' graph (x-axis is fixed length so plot moves to always
            show most recent data; how recent is user-decided)
        ->  latest version is 2.0.0

  - socketLS372.py
        ->  first program to communicate with LS372; just a test program, to
            see how the communication with the instrument works.

  - tempData.dat
        ->  generated by my_socket.py or realTime_my_socket.py; contains the
            data from the measurement during the running of either program
        ->  current file contains data obtained from running cryostat over 
            August 3, 2018 - August 6, 2018

*****************************************************************************
III. Comments

  - realTime_my_socket.py is planned to read temperature from all 8 channels

  - starting August 14, 2018, new directory "Cryo-Monitor" will contain the 
    programs to read the LS372 in real time, to display the website, and
    obtain data from the environment (e.g. cooling water flow rate, 
    temperature of the He compressor, and the temperature and humidity of 
    the lab

I. Motivation
  - want to get the temperature of the 8 channels in the dilution refrigerator
  (DR)
  - monitor the temperature remotely for convenience
  - facilitate data and error analysis

*****************************************************************************
II. Program Descriptions

  - my_socket.py
        ->  first program to take data; used to take data over Aug.3 - Aug.6

  - plotter_socket.py
        ->  plots the data in 'tempData.dat'; simply run it with the data you
            want to plot in 'tempData.dat', but needs to be in a specific
            format

  - realTime_my_socket.py
        ->  reads temperature from channel 2 of LS372 and plots in real time;
            two types of plots are available: 'static' graph (x-axis is not
            fixed length, so accommodates more and more data with time) and
            'shifting' graph (x-axis is fixed length so plot moves to always
            show most recent data; how recent is user-decided)

  - socketLS372.py
        ->  first program to communicate with LS372; just a test program, to
            see how the communication with the
            instrument works.

  - tempData.dat
        ->  generated by my_socket.py or realTime_my_socket.py; contains the
            data from the measurement during the running of either program

*****************************************************************************
III. Comments

  - realTime_my_socket.py is planned to read temperature from all 8 channels
